Zenph Studios Yamaha Disklavier Pro Piano Multisamples for OLPC

  A collection of Grand Piano samples played by a Yamaha Disklavier Pro.
  Performed by computer and specifically recorded for OLPC by Dr. Mikhail
  Krishtal, Director of Music Research and Production, and his team at Zenph
  Studios. They are included in the OLPC sound sample library.

  How is it being done: "The Disklavier Pro has an internal
  electronically-controlled mechanism that allows it to play sounds with very
  precise specifications. It has its own file format known as XP MIDI, an
  extension of standard midi. I [Mikhail Krishtal] prepare the files for it to
  play -- in this case, representing notes of different registers, durations,
  and dynamic levels."

  Produced by Zenph Studios in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The main studio
  location is in Raleigh, North Carolina. http://zenph.com/
